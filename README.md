# Neighborhood Map(React) Project

This is one of my Front End Web Developer NanoDegree Project of Udacity in React.

create-react-app was used to create this app, which includes a ServiceWorker to cache data for offline viewing. Offline viewing feature works only when application is deployed in production mode.
For Deployment detail please check the link : https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

## Overview
This is a single page responsive web site that uses a Map API (like Google Maps API) and another venues type of API [like FourSquare API] to show locations on a map via markers with a filterable list of those locations. I have followed Udacity Project Rubric for specific requirements. This project uses React, Google Maps, and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to present a map and markers of places to show the Elementary Schools in Englewood, CO.
